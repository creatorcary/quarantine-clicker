# Quarantine Clicker
Clicker game inspired by the quarantine of COVID-19

Welcome to Quarantine Clicker!
***To play the game, run lcary_qclicker.py***

Stuck inside during the pandemic, we all found ourselves doing some things more frequently. Some took up baking, while others became fitness gurus overnight. The object of the game is to collect as much income as possible by completing various quarantine tasks. Money can be used to upgrade tasks or hire robots to complete the tasks for you. To get started, repeatedly click the icons of each task. When the green click meter fills up, you will be rewarded with that task's money reward. Upgrading tasks will increase the amount you receive for completing the tasks.

Good luck!
