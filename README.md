# Quarantine Clicker
Clicker game inspired by the sudden change of lifestyles for many at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Welcome to Quarantine Clicker!

Stuck inside during the pandemic, we all found ourselves doing some things more frequently. Some took up baking while others became fitness gurus overnight. The object of this short game is to maximize income as possible by completing various quarantine tasks. Money can be used to upgrade tasks or hire robots to complete the tasks for you. To get started, repeatedly click the icons of each task. When the green click meter fills up, you will be rewarded with that task's money reward. Upgrading tasks will increase the amount you receive for completing the tasks.
